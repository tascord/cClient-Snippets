# cClient Snippets
Some snippets from cClient that people might find useful!

Feel free to use all this stuff however, you don't need to credit me anywhere.

## This repo uses [lombok](https://projectlombok.org/), get it.
If you don't want it, you shouldn't need to do much modification to get it to work.
Or, use a de-lomboker for minimal effort

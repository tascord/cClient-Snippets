# GUI > Elements
All elements here rely on the Element.java file to be present, as they extend it.
Theres a bit of weird stuff here I need for my implimentations, feel free to discard anything you don't need.

## Notes
ClientToggle bases its head's size on the width of the slider, this should change shortly.
ClientSlider currently requires it's width to be above 100, this will change shortly.
